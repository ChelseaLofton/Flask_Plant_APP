# Project Green Thumb

## Project Green Thumb is a web app that simplifies indoor plant health monitoring with real-time sensor data from the Home Assistant API. The app displays charts of soil moisture, conductivity, and location humidity, and allows you to control sensors and outlets remotely

## Features

* Real-time sensor data from the Home Assistant API

* Charts that display soil moisture, conductivity, and location humidity

* Control of sensors and outlets remotely

* Plant images that grant access to live sensor data and unique requirements in the database

* Alerts that notify you when the plant requires attention

* Integration with the Open Plant Book API to query essential information for your plant of interest

## Technologies

Project Green Thumb is built using Python, React JS, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and Charts.js.

## Future Updates

While adding new plants is not currently implemented, a future update will allow creating a new plant object by assigning a name and sensor number with care information.
